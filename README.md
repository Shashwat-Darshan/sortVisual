**Sorting Showdown**

Welcome to Sorting Showdown, a visually engaging website that brings sorting algorithms to life!

**What is it?**

Sorting Showdown is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and compare the performance of
different sorting algorithms. Our platform uses a unique blend of colors, numbers, and graph visualization to
create an immersive experience that's both fun and educational.

**How does it work?**

1. Choose a sorting algorithm: Select from a variety of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort,
Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
2. Enter a list size: Set the number of elements in the list you'd like to sort.
3. Click "Sort": Our algorithm will sort the list using the selected method and display the results in real-time.
4. Compare algorithms: Use our graph visualization feature to compare the performance of different sorting
algorithms side-by-side.

**Features**

* **Color-coded visualizations**: Our platform uses a vibrant color scheme to represent different elements in the
sorted list, making it easy to follow the sorting process.
* **Number line graphs**: Watch as numbers are inserted and removed from the graph, creating an engaging
visualization of the sorting algorithm's progression.
* **Interactive controls**: Easily adjust parameters like list size, number of iterations, or visualize multiple
algorithms at once.
* **Algorithm explanations**: Learn about each sorting algorithm's strengths, weaknesses, and time complexities.

**Benefits**

* Develop a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms and their trade-offs.
* Improve your problem-solving skills by visualizing complex concepts in an intuitive way.
* Enhance your presentation skills by showcasing the benefits of efficient data structures and algorithms.
